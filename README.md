# DBT-Reconstruction


 DESCRIPTION:

    The goal of this software is to present an open source reconstruction 
    toolbox, which features the three basic types of DBT reconstruction, 
    with the possibility of different acquisition geometries. This toolbox 
    is intended for academic usage and it aims at expanding the academic 
    research in this field.  Since it is an open source toolbox, 
    researchers are welcome to contribute to the current version of the 
    software.
